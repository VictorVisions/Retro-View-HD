# Retro-View-HD
Retro-View HD is a VGA to HDMI output solution in development for use with the [Shinobi-Scaler](https://github.com/mackieks/Shinobi-Scaler) 2. This project requires advanced soldering skills and is not an alternative to the broad market as it is currently a DIY project and will not be mass produced. As an open source project the original KiCad and design files will be provided, the files can be modified and is open to collaboration efforts in order to improve upon the design.

# Design and Build Files
Under Releases you'll find the latest Design and Build zip files. The Design folder will contain KiCad files along with the Schematic while the Build file will contain your BOM and Gerber files.

# Purchasing the PCB
Under Releases download the latest version of the Build folder and upload the file named "Retro-View-HD_Gerber_Files.zip" to your preffered PCB manufacturing site such as... 
[https://jlcpcb.com/](https://jlcpcb.com/), [https://oshpark.com/](https://oshpark.com/) or similar PCB Manufacturers.

The reccomended PCB Specifications are:

- 1mm-thick 2-layer PCB
- ENIG finish
- Tented Via Coverings

# Sourcing the components
All components can be ordered via Mouser minus the ZY5621 (U1) which can be ordered through [https://www.aliexpress.com/i/3256801691060726.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/3256801691060726.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt).
I have listed a Bill of Materials (BOM) with part numbers to be used for ordering components through Mouser. You can find this under the Build folder labeled "Retro_View_HD_BOM.xlsx".
